### Vinicius De Martin Viude
A long time ago I started to develop software and I love doing this.
For many years I also have worked with education doing the management of several courses.

At May, 2020 at middle of COVID-19 pandemic I've been fired from my educational job and decided to dedicate all my time to do what I most love.
So I have founded the Minds For AI company. Its main focus is to develop IA applications accessible to everyone.

Here I will publish code that can be used in your applications too.

Come on! Let's make AI for everyone.
